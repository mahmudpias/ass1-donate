            <h1>Their lives depend on your donation</h1>
            <p>After a devastating flood in early June that affected around 4 million residents, the same area was hit
                again with record-breaking rainfall that began on June 15. Most of the Sylhet city has gone underwater
                again, with water continuing to rise, worsening the condition of those still living in temporary
                shelters and further exposed to extreme weather and waterborne diseases</p>
            <p>The flood has affected nearly 7 million people throughout Bangladesh-worst-flood-hit areas. Most of the
                affected communities are already living in poor conditions</p>

            <h1>They need us to survive</h1>
            <p>The flood inundation has submerged houses, wells, latrines and agricultural lands disrupting basic
                services and forcing families to seek shelter. Thousands of families are facing severe shortage of food,
                drinking water and sanitation which can result in outbreak of widespread waterborne diseases.</p>
            <p>Children are also highly vulnerable to snake bites and drowning in such situation.</p>
